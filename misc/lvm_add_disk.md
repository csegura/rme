# Introduction & Explanation

Why LVM?

The reason why we love LVM is because when you need to increase the space it’s really easy. If you have vanilla EXT4 and you want to enlarge it, then you need to work out extents and at this point we feel it’s too complicated and technical. See here if you simply want to add a new EXT4 disk without LVM.

Below are the commands used to get the whole operation going.

If you can follow the commands you can do a TL;DR and get into the fast lane with adding new disks to Debian based distributions.

An actual breakdown is roughly as follows.

What they never explain to you are all the layers.

Here is a quick overview:

First you create a hardware disk if you’re using virtualisation.
If you have a box, you add a new hard drive with a Philips screwdriver.

– Then you create a partition table.
– Then you create a physical volume.
– Then you create a volume group
– Then you create a logical volume
– Then you make a file system, taking a note of the UUID
– Then you create a mount point
– Then you mount the drive
– Then you update the operating system to tell it about the new drive. This is done in /etc/fstab.

Did you get that? Can you repeat it?

Here is shortened way of explaining all the layers:

add hardware->sudo->fdisk->pvcreate->vgcreate->lvcreate->mfks->mkdir->mount->fstab

Now you are in the fast lane.

TL;DR commands used
``` 
sudo -i
fdisk -l
fdisk /dev/sdc
   n [New partition]
   p [Primary partition]
   1
   default
   default
   w [Write changes]
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
vgcreate backup-vg /dev/sdb1
lvcreate -n lv_backup2 -l 100%FREE backup-vg
mkfs.ext4 /dev/backup-vg/lv_backup2
echo UUID=e6f1b700-1c3f-4f69-bc53-f0f3d6f36495 /mnt/backup2 ext4 defaults 0 2 >> /etc/fstab
mkdir /mnt/backup2
mount /mnt/backup2/
df -h
```
Here is an actual operation in progress, with the full output. Some irrelevant command outputs were removed:

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x90d7397a.

Command (m for help): n
Partition type
p primary (0 primary, 0 extended, 4 free)
e extended (container for logical partitions)
Select (default p):

Using default response p.
Partition number (1-4, default 1):

Last sector, +/-sectors or +/-size{K,M,G,T,P} (2048-2147483647, default 2147483647):

Created a new partition 1 of type 'Linux' and of size 1024 GiB.
